# What's new and upcoming

![inline](images/doge.gif)

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# CocoaPods 0.38

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# support for watchOS

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  # â€¦
  s.watchos.deployment_target = '2.0'
end
```

# Target Deduplication

Happens by default, exceptions:

* They are used on different platforms.
* They are used with differents sets of subspecs.
* They have any dependency which needs to be duplicated.

# Breaking Change to the Hooks-API

```ruby
post_install do |installer_or_rep|
  # @note: Remove after CocoaPods 0.38+ is completely rolled out
  # and rename block argument to `installer`.
  installer = installer_or_rep.respond_to?(:installer) ? 
    installer_or_rep.installer : installer_or_rep

  # You can use the installer from now on.
end
```

---

# Split of `xcconfig`

- `pod_target_xcconfig`
- `user_target_xcconfig`

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# Other changes

- Removal of the Enviroment Header
- Deterministic UUIDs by Xcodeproj
- Resolver takes the Deployment Target into account

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

## Make sure you check out `blog.cocoapods.org` and the `CHANGELOG` for major releases

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# CocoaPods 0.39

- currently beta 4
- Vendored dynamic frameworks ðŸŽ‰
- `--private` option for linting (ignore warnings only suitable for trunk)
- `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` is no longer constructed recursively

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# Road to 1.0

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

## Major Changes

# Customizable Installation

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

## Customizable Installation

- ~~`--no-integrate`~~
- Same default
- Pass options to the installer

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

## Major Changes

# Target Inheritance

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

## Target Inheritance

- ~~`:exclusive => true`~~
- New options
    - Complete
    - Search paths
    - None

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

## Target Inheritance

- Allows test targets to work
- Allows for more 'logical' Podfiles

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

## Coming this fall

Hopefully

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# CocoaPods plugins

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# CocoaPods plugins

- Add subcommands to `pod`, the tool
- `post_install` hook
- Each plugin is a Gem

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

## Do whatever you want, because Ruby ðŸ’Ž

# Useful plugins

# Check Pods Manifest.lock

if [[ $? != 0 ]] ; then
    cat << EOM
error: The sandbox is not in sync with the Podfile.lock. 
Run 'pod install' or update your CocoaPods installation.

# Link Binary With Libraries

- Links the aggregate framework
- Gets build via implicit dependencies

# Troubleshooting

![](images/troubleshooting.gif)

---

# Mixing Objective-C and Swift in a Pod

- Frameworks can't have a separate bridging header
- Objective-C headers can be included in the umbrella header

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# First solution: module imports

```swift
import ObjectiveCPod
```

=> You get the full public API

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# Second solution: publiclize all the things

- Create a header
- Import all the Objective-C headers you need
- Add that header to `public_header_files`

=> Exposes the dependency in the public API

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# Third solution: custom module map

- Module maps can have private submodules

```
framework module ResearchKit {
    umbrella header "ResearchKit.h"
    
    module Private {
        umbrella header "ResearchKit_Private.h"
        export *
    }
    
    export *
    module * { export * }
}
```

- Can be declared in the podspec with `module_map`

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# Reset your integration

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods-deintegrate
$ pod deintegrate
$ pod install
```

# Tips

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# Use bundler to pin your used CocoaPods version

```bash
$ cat Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'cocoapods', '= 0.36.0.beta.1'
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec pod install # from now on
```

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# Make sure your dependencies don't go away

- Commit the `Pods` directory
- Mirror your Pods (<https://github.com/xing/XNGPodsSynchronizer>)

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# You can keep the Pods history separate

- Create an orphaned branch on your repo
- Check it out as a submodule to `Pods`
- History is now completely separate

![](images/cocoapods.jpg)

---

# Automate your workflow

- Use plugins
- Use a Rakefile or Makefile for common tasks
- Use `pre_install` or `post_install` hooks in the Podfile
